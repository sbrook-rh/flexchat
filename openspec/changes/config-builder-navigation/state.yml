title: Configuration Builder Navigation Refactor

description: |
  Refactor the Configuration Builder UI to use vertical tab navigation,
  supporting scalable addition of configuration sections (Providers,
  Embeddings, Intent, Handlers, Reasoning) with conditional enabling
  and visual status indicators.

scope:
  - Frontend UI layout refactor
  - NavigationSidebar component
  - Tab state management
  - Conditional tab enabling logic
  - Badge indicators for counts
  - Placeholder sections for future phases

impact:
  breaking: false
  components:
    - frontend/src/ConfigBuilder.jsx
    - frontend/src/NavigationSidebar.jsx (new)
    - frontend/src/ConfigSection.jsx (new)
    - frontend/src/sections/ProvidersSection.jsx (new)
    - frontend/src/sections/EmbeddingsSection.jsx (new)
    - frontend/src/sections/IntentSection.jsx (new)
    - frontend/src/sections/HandlersSection.jsx (new)
    - frontend/src/sections/ReasoningSection.jsx (new)
  specs:

estimated_effort: 1-2 days

notes: |

  - No breaking changes to Phase 2 functionality
  - Foundation for Phases 3-5 feature additions
  - Simple state-based tabs (no routing library)
  - Emoji icons for MVP (can upgrade later)
